Hello, this repository is my first ever GitHub repository. This repository will contain files and scripts related to signals and systems, where signals are created and modified. Every week, one or more files in this repository will be changed or modified. The point of this repository is to learn an effective usage of GitHub and its main features, as well as store scripts and files used for our projects in signals and systems.

Dear collaborators, Welcome!
